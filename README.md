# note-taker

The following files contain code for a note-taker.
With the use of expressjs, api's as well as node js, GET and POST requests have been done to write and display notes on the page.
Once you type out a note and hit the save button on the top right corner the note will be posted on the left side of the page under the title name you assigned to it.
Heroku has also been used to deploy the page linked below.
